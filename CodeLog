Toy examples done. url -> related docs.
Data structures now starting to take shape.

We can use more indexes.
Decouple the index like in SQL, so the same code runs faster if the index
exists.

Added agg3 ui to it. Messy that I've added stations to the flat-history model.
  Form to create new station.
  Choose between stations, each station gets its own read-list.
