Test 7 isn't consistent.
=-=2 - Fri Dec  4 18:17:19 PST 2009

Toy examples done. url -> related docs.
Data structures now starting to take shape.

Tests are ugly, code interleaved with data.
We can use more indexes.
Decouple the index like in SQL, so the same code runs faster if the index
exists.

Finished building the index. gen-docs works.

Added agg3 ui to it. Messy that I've added stations to the flat-history model.
  Form to create new station.
  Choose between stations, each station gets its own read-list.

Importing agg3 crawl pipeline. Next step: merge properly.

Vision: crawl a universal set of feeds. Don't wait for entire crawl to import
crawled feeds. Track per-user feeds and feed priorities in userinfo*. Make
agg3 just another station for users who import feeds. Push station selection
to a new screen; add new station form to the left panel when reading. Track
history by station.

Later: screens to manage feeds. Stations for importing email, other data
sources, etc. Discovering new feeds during crawl.

crawl and htmlclean now communicate by fifo.
But it's currently blocking. So htmlclean blocks until input, then just reads
the first input and goes back to waiting. Meanwhile if I add a delay to
htmlclean it blocks crawl instead.

If we stick with the blocking model we need to start the pipeline in reverse
order, from consumer to producer of each fifo.

If any stage dies, all other stages will block.

Will we lose stuff in fifos if we kill arc? Periodically look at files under
urls/

Redefine defscan to run in separate threads, not a single thread.
Also some reorg.

3 Crawl errors fixed.
